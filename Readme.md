## Implement an LRU cache

* Implement a thread-safe cache with a limited capacity of objects
* Use the least recently used strategy to decide which object to kick out when the capacity is exceeded when adding a new entry (you kick out the element that least recently has been read or written).
* Unit test your code
* Timeboxed to 60 min.
* Do not forget to send your solution to us afterwards
